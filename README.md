# Digital Logic
A small python module to help preform boolean algebra and state table calculations

![Example](/images/example2.png)
* Example of digitallogic with numpy in [nteract](https://nteract.io/).

## Dependancy's
 - [Numpy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/index.html)

## Installation
To install, activate virtual chosen virtual enviroment.
```
source ./path/to/activate
```
Clone repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/mtseng15/digitallogic.git
```
Use pip to install.
```
cd digitallogic
pip install
```

## Goals
The goal is not to be a one stop all module. There are plenty of great projects out there for doing binary data analysis. The goal is simply to complement the capabilities of numpy and to ease the process of digital logic calculations. 

## Things to do
- [x] Get Setup wheel and pip installation
- [x] Add function to output calculations to CSV file
- [ ] Add more flip flop application tables
- [ ] Add more standard input arrays (i.e., 2^5, 2^6, etc)
- [ ] Error handling...beacuse it's a good thing and so far non-existant :)

Please feel free to submit pull requests! Contributions are more than welcome as longs as they follow the goals of this project.
