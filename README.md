# Digital Logic
A small python module to help preform boolean algebra and state table calculations

![Example](/images/example.jpg)

## Dependancy's
 - [Numpy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/index.html)
 	Install numpy using pip

## Installation
At some point here, I will get a setup wheel going, but for now just copy the file into your site-packages folder.

## Goals
The goal is not to be a one stop all module. There are plenty of great projects out there for doing binary data analysis. The goal is simply to complement the capabilities of numpy to ease the process of using numpy for digital logic calculations. 

## Things to do
- [ ] Get Setup wheel and pip installation
- [ ] Add function to output calculations to CSV file
- [ ] Add more flip flop application tables
- [ ] Add more standard input arrays (i.e., 2^5, 2^6, etc)

Please feel free to submit pull requests! Contributions are more than welcome as longs as they follow the goals of this project.
